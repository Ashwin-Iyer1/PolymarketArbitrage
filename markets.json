        "description": "On November 21, 2024, Matt Gaetz announced that he would be withdrawing himself from consideration for the position of Attorney General after having previously been announced as Trump’s nominee.\n\nThis market will resolve to \"Yes\" if at least three individuals (including Gaetz) picked by Donald Trump for cabinet-level positions requiring Senate confirmation are withdrawn (failing a Senate confirmation vote will not alone qualify). Otherwise, this market will resolve to “No”.\n\nA Cabinet position is defined as any of the heads of the 15 executive departments or a role formally designated as Cabinet-level by the President. Advisory roles will not qualify for this market.\n\nAny individual who Trump has announced an intention to nominate will be considered. Similarly, announcements from the nominee, Trump or one of his representatives that the nominee will be withdrawn will qualify for this market.\n\nA candidate who fails a senate confirmation vote will not be considered to have been withdrawn until their withdrawal has been announced or another candidate has been named instead. For example, if Hegseth fails a confirmation vote, but is later appointed through a recess appointment, this would not count as Hegseth withdrawing. However, if Hegseth were to fail a confirmation vote and then was withdrawn and replaced with another nominee, this would qualify as Hegseth withdrawing. \n\nIf a candidate has not officially assumed the role they were nominated for by June 30, 2025, 11:59 PM ET, they will be considered to have been withdrawn. \n\nThis market will resolve to \"No\" as soon as all relevant positions are filled without meeting the conditions for a \"Yes\" resolution.\n\nThe resolution source for this market will be a consensus of credible reporting.",

        "question": "Will Elena Lasconi win the Romanian Presidential election by 5-10%?",
        "description": "The Romanian Presidential Election runoff is scheduled to be held on December 8, between Călin Georgescu and Elena Lasconi.\n\nThis market will resolve to \"Yes” if Elena Lasconi wins the 2024 Romanian Presidential Election runoff by between 5.0% (inclusive) and 10.0% (exclusive) when compared with the second place candidate. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nFor the purpose of resolving this market, the 'margin of victory' is defined as the absolute difference between the percentages of votes received by the first and second-place candidate. Percentages of the votes received by each candidate will be determined by dividing the total number of votes each of the top two candidates receives by the sum of all votes cast in Romanian Presidential Election runoff.\n\nThis market will resolve based off the official vote count once the votes count has been made official.\n\nIf a recount is initiated before the vote total has been made official, the market will remain open until the recount is completed and the vote is made official.\n\nThis market will resolve based on the official results of the election, as reported by a consensus of credible reporting. If there is ambiguity, this market resolves based on the election results from the Romanian Government, specifically the Permanent Electoral Authority (https://www.roaep.ro/prezentare/).",

        "description": "The Romanian Presidential Election runoff is scheduled to be held on December 8, between Călin Georgescu and Elena Lasconi.\n\nThis market will resolve to \"Yes” if Călin Georgescu wins the 2024 Romanian Presidential Election runoff by between 0% (inclusive) and 5.0% (exclusive) when compared with the second place candidate. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nFor the purpose of resolving this market, the 'margin of victory' is defined as the absolute difference between the percentages of votes received by the first and second-place candidate. Percentages of the votes received by each candidate will be determined by dividing the total number of votes each of the top two candidates receives by the sum of all votes cast in Romanian Presidential Election runoff.\n\nThis market will resolve based off the official vote count once the votes count has been made official.\n\nIf a recount is initiated before the vote total has been made official, the market will remain open until the recount is completed and the vote is made official.\n\nThis market will resolve based on the official results of the election, as reported by a consensus of credible reporting. If there is ambiguity, this market resolves based on the election results from the Romanian Government, specifically the Permanent Electoral Authority (https://www.roaep.ro/prezentare/).",
